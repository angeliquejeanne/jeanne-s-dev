I am a web integrator passionate about what I do, transforming models into a website and recently a front-end web developer in alternation. Some technologies I like to work with include html + css + sass + scss, JavaScript + jQuery + Babel + Vanilla, Git + GitHub, VSCode. I recently started learning React.js & React-Native.
